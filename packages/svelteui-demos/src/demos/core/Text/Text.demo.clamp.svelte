		From Bulbapedia: Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker
		patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and
		a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper
		jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's
		back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also
		conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines.
