## Basics

Svelte's preprocessor gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to writing your components. It is the very thing that enables you to use things like Sass or Typescript in your Svelte Markup. SvelteUI has created a new package to provide you powerful features for your development.

### Order

Preprocessors can be very powerful when used correctly. Something that is very important is the order in which you place your preprocessors, because they are executed in the order they are placed in.
